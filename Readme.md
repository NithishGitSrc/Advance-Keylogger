## Project Overview

In today's dynamic business landscape, organizations face the constant challenge of securing their sensitive information against cyber threats and data breaches. Our Advanced Keylogger project aims to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive tool for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities within computer systems.


## Introduction

In modern business operations heavily reliant on computer systems, the threat of cyber-attacks is a critical concern. Our Advanced Keylogger serves as a proactive defense mechanism, designed to monitor employee activities and detect potential security threats. It goes beyond traditional keyloggers by capturing various types of information, including keystrokes, screenshots, application logs, and system logs.

## Features

- **Captures Keystrokes**: Our system records keystrokes for detailed analysis.
- **Screenshots Capture**: Capture screenshots for a visual record of user activity.
- **Application Logs**: Collect logs generated by applications for comprehensive insights.
- **System Logs**: Record system logs to analyze system-level activities.
